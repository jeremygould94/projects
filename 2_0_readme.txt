Readme for Word of the Day - Hangman

Steps
1. Download the script and all hangman images.
2. Save all in the same location.
3. Run script.

This script uses webscraping to pull info from the "word of the day" section of dictionary.com by pulling the html.
Then does string manipulation to get the word, defition etc (so if the website changes, it might break the first bit).

Next, we use pygame to create a game of hangman based around the word.

If you win, the definition, pronunciation etc for the word are displayed.
